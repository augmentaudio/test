  B2C companies have enough structured data to train sophisticated machine

  paradigms to collect data to then train sophisticated models to help their
  businesses.

I keep getting floored with how generous this community is! So many people have been so gracious with their time and it's very humbling. This week, we'd like to point out some more insights from the amazing Marketers and Sales Leaders we have engaged with.

Everyone knows that A.I. (machine learning and deep learning specifically) is possible only with the right data. **The B2B world is fusing their sales, marketing, operations, and IT efforts as one cohesive unit to drive growth**. In parallel, companies are retraining their domain level experts with data science skills, which consist mostly of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model factories. Python and R are the programming languages of choice, bar none.

Businesses, generally speaking, are adopting **lean methodologies within marketing and sales groups**. Lean methodologies are also known as agile methodologies. Development and operations teams have used these methods for some time and now marketing and sales are adopting them too. This allows groups to **iterate and test faster**. Daily stand-ups and kanban boards are the norms.

B2B companies are very much in favor of using Account Based Marketing (ABM) strategies than they were even a year ago. Focusing on a specific set of accounts and contacts within those accounts provides some very different use cases for A.I. ABM, per se, is not a new concept, but **AI can help identify trends within companies (also known as intent data)** that allow marketing and sales groups provide more targeted messaging with the proper channel.

B2C companies are embracing new user experiences very quickly, particularly with chatbots and voice-activated speakers. This isn't a surprise for anyone, and the number of companies developing their own versions of chatbots and voice interfaces is huge (granted, the underlying frameworks are limited in number). This naturally will bring a new set of challenges to the table, as data stored in this manner is unstructured and therefore requires very different analysis and processing techniques to un-tap the data's potential.

What's interesting is to hear opinions on how fast **B2B companies will adopt voice activated systems, sophisticated chatbots, and content creation models**. Built well and these new user experience interfaces can help remove some of the obstacles of updating internal systems with enough data to train A.I. models. Put another way, not only do these new user experiences have the potential of improving adoption, but they also provide opportunities for companies to obtain enough data to train A.I. models that are performant enough to improve their internal processes.
