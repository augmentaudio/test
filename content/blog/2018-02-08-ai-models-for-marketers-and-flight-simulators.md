First of all, I need to start doing some shout outs! Thank you, [Ken Chow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/techmarketingleader/), [Chris Gosselin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisgosselinusafvet/), [Christina Ellwood](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinaellwood/), [Anna Yong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/4everfusion/), [Marko Savic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/savicmarko/), [Lisbeth McNabb](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisbethmcnabb/), and [Glenn Fossella](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glenfossella/) for taking a few moments out of your busy days to provide us with some insights!

## Good AI Models Need Good Data - And Lots of It

Just like software companies are creating models for autonomous vehicles with simulated training data, B2B marketers and sales leaders can also consider training models using simulated data that are smart enough to help augment their efforts. It is no secret that in the B2C world the amount of data available is immense, and better yet, the data comes at us (generally speaking) in standard schemas, since there are so many great tools available to pipe data into data warehouses or data lakes without a lot of effort. But in the B2B world the data is fragmented and trickles in, and in many cases, the data doesn't reflect the reality of what happened. (Who likes data entry?).

So the question is, how can we train effective A.I. models to help marketers and sales pros in the B2B world? There are a few answers and there are a lot of companies trying to tackle this problem. The larger Martech vendors are embedding AI within their stacks to help suggest ways to find qualified leads and then suggest ways of engaging these leads automatically. Other tools are available which help sales professionals update CRM records so that they don't have to worry about data entry issues. Some companies are even creating content, with context, automatically, to engage people with targeted and relevant messages.

## Flight Simulators

So how about creating simulation data and training models based on said simulation data? Instead of having a Pilot sitting in the seat using simulated flight data, perhaps we could come up with training data to increase deal size, improve ROI, and compress sales cycles.

DevOps engineers have been doing this for a while now. Teams create simulation data with different failures, attack vectors, among other scenarios so when the real thing comes they are prepared. B2B marketers and sales leaders could have simulation data that increases the number of qualified leads to triple at the end of the month, simulate different inbound touch points, ABM strategies that are in different geographies, etc. and create AI models based on this information.

What really struck me is how creating the simulation data could be another AI model, so in essence one A.I. model could train another A.I. model!
