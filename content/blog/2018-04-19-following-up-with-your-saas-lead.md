# Following up with Your SaaS Lead

You’ve perfected your inbound marketing and you’re loving the quality and speed of your SaaS B2B lead service, but now it’s time to close the deal!

But before we dive in here are a few things to sip on:

* What’s effective today that will truly capture the sales qualified lead (SQL) attention?
* What prospecting time-leeches should you avoid and why?
* Why is it so important to keep your sales process relevant in this new digital age?

## Where should you start?

No surprise here, we’ve done the research and the tried and true best-practice to** follow up with your SaaS lead is by sending emails**. You are busy, your awesome high-ranked lead is also busy so your first touch point in the sales process should begin with an email. We’ll discuss later how to avoid being generic and tips on developing you message content. A well crafted email can be very effective in not only creating leads but also engaging throughout the process. 

Next tools to perfect your follow up process should be the phone call and voicemail which is where you will refer to the content of your email/s. Phone calls allow you to close the deal as you:

* Have an active audience
* Are able to understand and learn the lead

## The Nitty Gritty

There are a lot of resources out there, but for the sake of the attention lifespan we’re focusing on the most compelling case studies out there which analyzed the sales processes of SaaS.

A recent study was conducted which analyzes the sales sequences of 281 top SaaS companies, in partnership with [PersistIQ](https://www.persistiq.com/), a sales emailing tool.  In the study, 3 companies drew attention with success of their sales sequences, which are Salesforce, New Relic, and Intacct.  The sales sequences of all these 3 companies all started with an automated email. Analyzing these companies' sales processes, **voicemails are considered a follow-up to emails**, referring to the email content and the most important goal of a salesperson is to have a phone call with the lead.  

If your follow-up to the first email (which is usually automated after initial lead qualification) is sent within an **optimal range of 3–8 days**, **the chances of getting a reply increase by 21%**. This increases to 25% for subsequent follow-ups. 

The best days to call your **SaaS leads are on Wednesdays and Thursdays, 5 minutes after a lead makes the first qualifying contact**. Studies show the optimal success when the leads were dialed around 8 am or 4–5 pm; and persisted for up to the 6th call, are some of the best practices necessary to stand a 90% chance of getting a follow-up contact with a SaaS lead.

What to remember: Emails are important for a first touch point with the lead and the phone calls are key to close the deal.

## Okay you get emails but what if…

So what about other lead sources. Let’s say you offer a free trial for your service, you may worry that if you reach out too fast you’ll look desperate or if you wait too long they’ll have gone with another option. But if you have a free trial that people can sign up for, calling them within 5 minutes after they registered, highly increases the chance of reaching the lead. The chance of turning the lead into a paying customer is 21 times higher.

To wrap things up… remember leads are real people just like you. Avoid the generic templates and personalize each message to your lead, their company, and how your product or service can help meet their goals.
